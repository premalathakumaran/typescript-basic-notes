MAIN POINT TO BE USED : Open PowerShell (No need for Administrator):

You don't need to run PowerShell as an administrator for this step.




THE POINTS FOR RUNNING THE TYPESCRIPT FOR THE FIRST TIME :

1. Change the Execution Policy for the Current User:
Run the following command in PowerShell

 MAIN COMMENT IS : --->  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

2.Verify the Change:
You can check that the policy has been changed by running

THIS IS TO CHECK THE FIRST COMMENT : ----> Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser

3.Run Your TypeScript Command Again:
Now, try running your tsc --init command again, and it should work without any issues.

TO RUN YOUR TYPESCRIPT -----> tsc --init (AFTER RUNNING THIS COMMENT IT SHOULD SHOWE THE tsconfig.json FILE.)
                       -----> tsc --watch 


tsc --init is the correct TypeScript command to initialize a new tsconfig.json file in your project. This command creates a default configuration file (tsconfig.json) in the directory where it's run, which is essential for configuring TypeScript's compiler options.

tsconfig.json FILE YOU WNAT CHANGE THE -------> IN MODULES TABLE CHANGE THIS TO THIS ("rootDir": "./", ===> "rootDir": "./src",)
                                       
                                       -----> IN EMIT TABLE CHANGE THIS TO THIS ( "outDir": "./"  ===>  "outDir": "./disnt")

4. TO CREATE HTML FILE TO DISPLAY THE CONSOLE LOG OUTPUT IN THE BROWSER how to see console.log output in brower in typescript while after running tsc --watch 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>TypeScript Console Output</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Check the Console for Output</h1>
  <script src="dist/index.js"></script> <!-- Path to your compiled JS file -->
</body>
</html>

   --------->  THEN AFTER SETTING UP CLICK (RIGHT ON HTML FILE THEN GIVE OPEN WITH LIVE SERVER)
